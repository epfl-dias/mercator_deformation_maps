# Mercator deformation maps

This is a rust conversion of the deformation maps support, as a library, for integration within Mercator.

The reference implementation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/brainvisa/aims-free/) as part of **AIMS**.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Requirements

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Run the tests

You can run the tests using:

```sh
cargo test
```

**Note**

 * These tests compare this implementation with the reference implementation. 
 * They assume the reference implementation provides correct results for its intended uses. 
 * A test is passing if the two implementations generate the same outputs.
 * The reference deformation map & test data is **NOT** included, but assumed to be available under `/data`.

## Documentation

If you want to build the documentation and access it locally, you can use:

```sh
